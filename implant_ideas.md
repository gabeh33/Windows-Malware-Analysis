# implant Ideas

## RPC
- JSON + HTTP / REST
/Task -->  {}
{"job_id":"12345", "cmd": <cmd type>, "args":[]}
- eg: whoami --> {"cmd":"whoami", "args":[]}
- whoami /priv --> {"cmd": "whoami", "args": "/priv"}
[{},...,{}]
- {"job_id": "12345", "result": "user"}



### Situational Awarenes
- current user
- privelegages
- current working directory
- Sandbox Detection 
- do we have an internet connection
- Network enumeration 
- connected devices 
- Windows Version 

### I/O
- uploading files
- downloading files
- file modification 
- disk enumeration (show me the cool files) *.pem, (anything secret or that contains secret data)
- Loot the system 

### Transport
- An HTTP(s) client
- getting tasks to execute from the c2
- sending the response to the c2 
- i.e., HTTP is how the implant will communicate with the c2 and egress from the victim network 
- RPC for our implant to use for example, Restful 

### Execution 
- Spawnining processes and getting the output 

### Defense Evasion
- Injection (Process Injection, or Reflective DLL Injection)

#### Crypto
- Encrypt traffic on top of TLS

#### Impact
- Ransomwhere
